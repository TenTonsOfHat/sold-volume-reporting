# Project Brief: Volume Reporting System

## Overview
A Python-based reporting system that generates volume reports from multiple SQL Server databases and consolidates them into Excel format.

## Core Requirements
1. Read database connection details from a JSON configuration file
2. Execute a standardized SQL query against multiple SQL Server databases
3. Generate individual CSV reports for each client
4. Combine all reports into a single Excel file with multiple sheets
5. Support daily report generation with date-based file naming

## Goals
- Provide a unified view of volume data across multiple clients
- Automate the reporting process
- Ensure consistent data formatting across all reports
- Make reports easily accessible and readable
