## Recent Changes
1. Switched from direct pyodbc to SQLAlchemy for database connections
2. Added auto-sizing of Excel columns
3. Modified file naming to use date-only format
4. Improved error handling and logging

## Next Steps
1. Consider adding:
   - Logging to file

   - Command-line options for date range
   - Report validation checks

## Active Decisions
- Using SQLAlchemy for database connectivity (best practice)
- Date-based file naming (YYYYMMDD format)
- Separate CSV files with consolidated Excel output
- Auto-sized columns for better readability

## Current Considerations
- Security of database credentials
- Performance with large datasets
- Error recovery strategies
